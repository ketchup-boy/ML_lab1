```

## Question 1

Creating the Scatter Plot:
The black dots are considered Diabetes level 0 while red dots are considered Diabetes level 1.

```{Q1}
mydata <- read.csv("C:/Users/Ana/Documents/LiU University/Machine Learning/csv data for labs/Lab 1 data/pima-indians-diabetes.csv")

plot(x = mydata$X50, 
     y = mydata$X148,
     xlab = "Age",
     ylab = "Plasma glucose concentration",
     main = "Age vs Plasma glucose concentration",
     col = as.factor(mydata$X1))
```

Do you think that Diabetes is easy to classify by a standard logistic regression model that uses these two variables as features? 



## Including Plots

You 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
